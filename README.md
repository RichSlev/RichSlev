## Richard Slevin

I am an ecophysiologist focused on ecosystem–climate interactions, with a particular interest in how vegetation and soil processes respond to environmental variability across time and space, and how these dynamics inform land management decision making and the ecology-climate-policy nexus. My background spans eddy covariance, remote sensing, ecohydrology, plant physiology and applied machine learning, with applications in forestry, peatlands, tropical drylands, agriculture and urban vegetation systems.

My work emphasises:
- Event-scale ecosystem responses (e.g. land-use change, rainfall pulses, disturbance dynamics)
- Reproducible, data-driven workflows
- Translating biophysical processes into operational metrics for policy discourse
